#flex

CSS grid that is flexible in options (including the option to make the grid flexible)

##Currently planning things out
The whole 12 columns thing isn't working for my brain - everyone seems to have a different way to use margins and then then 1 column with margins vs. 2 columns with margins creates a whole new mess. I want to be able to say:  

1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1  
2,2,2,2,2,2  
3,3,3,3  
4,4,4  
1,5,5,1  
6,6  
12  
etc..

But try doing the 1's in a grid and things work fine, but then do the 2's and things don't work out fine. Margins seem to be an issue. So maybe just get rid of the margins and treat them as columns as well? And then re-arrange things? What if everything was the same size, like legos? Yes...that would work. Maybe I should try that next.
