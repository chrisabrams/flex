This creates a 20px gutter between columns and 10px on either end.\r\n\r\n###Core\r\nThere are 3 core pieces to the grid: .container, .row, and .columnXX\r\n - .container determines the size/flex of the grid and is the parent to .row\r\n - .row is a vertical break - each .row is stacked on top of one another\r\n - .columnXX is a horizontal block that can span 1-12 column(s) and is the parent of content on the page\r\n\r\n###Basic 2 column example\r\nA basic layout split 50/50 on the grid looks like this:\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"container\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"row\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"column06\">I'm the left side.</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"column06\">I'm the right side.</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>","tagline":"CSS grid that is flexible in options (including the option to make the grid flexible)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
